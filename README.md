This Chrome extension is designed to eliminate the monotony of filling out job applications, auto-filling basic information like your name and location in a snap.

🔍 But "Apply Ease" goes beyond just auto-filling. It understands that personalized answers to questions like "Why do you want to join us?" or "Why should we hire you?" are crucial. Using the job description and your resume, it generates compelling, customized responses to these important questions.

✨ How "Apply Ease" works:
1) Auto-fills standard application fields to save you time.
2) For custom questions like "Why do you want to join us?" it fetches the job description and application question.
3) Sends this information to a Node.js server, where your resume is parsed for key information and it is sent to OpenAI API.
4) Utilizes the OpenAI API to craft personalized answers that make your application stand out.
